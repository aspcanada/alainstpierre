## Overview

Maptiks is a SaaS platform designed to provide web map owners with actionable analytics, offering insights into user interactions such as map loads, load times, clicks, pans, zooms, and layer engagement. Often described as “Google Analytics for web maps,” Maptiks integrates seamlessly with industry-standard mapping tools like Mapbox, Google Maps, Esri, AGOL, LeafletJS, OpenLayers, and Mango.

During my time at Sparkgeo, I contributed extensively to both Maptiks 2.0 and 3.0, driving advancements in scalability, cost-efficiency, user experience, and adaptability for enterprise and military use cases.

## Challenges

The platform faced several challenges:
- Providing real-time, detailed analytics for map-specific interactions that traditional tools couldn’t capture.
- Scaling the system to handle growing user demand while optimizing costs.
- Adapting the platform to meet the needs of enterprise and military clients, including offline and on-premise deployments.
